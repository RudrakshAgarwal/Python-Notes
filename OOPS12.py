What Is Polymorphism?

In basic English language, Polymorphism means to exist in different states. The same object or thing changing its state from one form to 
another is known as polymorphic. A same function or method, being used differently in different scenarios can perfectly describe polymorphism. 
It occurs mostly with base and derived class.  

Understanding Polymorphism in Python

The concept of polymorphism has very strong ties with method overriding concept that we will learn in the next Tutorial 
of this course along with super() function. In Python, it is mostly related to objects or the values of variables that are assigned 
in different classes. For example, if a method in the child class that has the same name as the methods in the parent class and also they 
take the same number of variables as parameters, then the child class will inherit the methods from the parent class and will override 
the method too. Meaning that the compiler will execute the method in the child because it will be the first place it looks while searching 
for the method when called. By overriding a method, we can also add some more functionalities in it, so in a way modifying the method in the 
child class but letting it remain the same in the parent class.

Polymorphism in '+' operator:-

In the above video tutorial, we have used the '+' arithmetic python operator two times in our programs. This is an example of the implementation 
of polymorphism in Python. We can use the same + operator whether we want to add two integers, or concatenate two strings, or extend two lists. 
The + arithmetic operator acts differently depending on the type of objects it is operating upon.
